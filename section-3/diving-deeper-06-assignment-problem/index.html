    <li>Build a nice box (
      <code>div</code>) with some content (e.g. "I'm a box!"), padding, a border (style it as you want) and some margin.</li>
    <li>If you didn't do it already: Set different padding and margin for the four different sides of the box.</li>
    <li>Add the same box below the first box and note if you can identify any strange behavior.</li>
    <li>Give the first box a height of 100% of the window height.</li>
    <li>Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of 300px and set its width to 50%.</li>
    <li>Position the two boxes next to each other.</li>
    <li>"Hide" box number 1 and see how that changes the page.</li>
    <li>Add a hover effect to the the LAST
      <code>div</code> element. Use pseudo-classes for that.</li>

      affect the global @angular/cli package, allowing you to quickly test any changes you make to the cli project. Now you
      can use @angular/cli via the command line:</p>
